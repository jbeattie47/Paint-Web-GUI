                <p>
                    I'm an undergrad in my third year currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science 
                    in Computer Science. Beyond school when I have free time <em>never</em>  
                    I enjoy lifting weights, going on hikes, and working on personal projects. I'm interested
                    to see what we learn in this class and what I'll be able to create with my team.

                <p>
                    I am a third year undergraduate student, majoring in computer science with a minor in informational securities and technologies.
                    When I am not coding, I like going to the gym, playing videogames, and hanging with friends/family.
                    I am super interested in web development, as I built my very own personal website last year!

                <p>
                    I am an undergrad student at CSU pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science. 
                    I hope to learn to think more like a programmer and learn vital skills for my career like teamwork, clean code, and strong communication. 
                    I want to learn more about computers broadly as I improve my coding skills and I would like to someday make my own game as a side project.
